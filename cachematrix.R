# This function creates a special matrix object
# that can cache its inverse. The input matrix is
# assumed to be an invertible matrix.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


#This function computes the inverse of the matrix object
#returned by the method above.  If the matrix hasn't changed
#and inverse has been already calculated, the this function
#retrieves the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
